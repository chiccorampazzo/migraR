# migraR
R package for migration analysis focused by now in the Rogers and Castro multi exponential model and the estimation of the parameters using a bayesian simulation based on uniform a priori distributions for each parameter between 0 and 1. 


This package was created by J. Sebastian Ruiz-Santacruz and Jackson Garc√©s in 2018.

To install the package in R, you must install first the package dplyr and devtools running the following statements:

`install.packages(dplyr)`

`install.packages(devtools)`

after running previous lines, you should use the function install.github to dowload de package as follows:

`install_github("elflacosebas/migraR")`

**Description**

The migraR package provides functions for estimate the parameters for Rogers and Castro Models: 
rc.7, rc.11, rc.13 like a package migest. You may create your own multiexponetial model making 
profit of the fucntion migramodel

**migraR functions**

The migraR functions were concived for estimate via non-linear optimization, the parameters of 
the Rogers and Castro models wit seven, eleven and thirteen parameters. Besides, the package 
gives the user the posibility to investigate wich curve fits better using the method provided 
in the IUSSP manual for the estimation of Rogers and Castro multi exponential model migration 
schedule.

Package under contiuous changes! place your bugs on the github tab issues :) :rocket:
